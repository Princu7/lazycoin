# Blockchain for lazycoin

An implementation of a blockchain used to manage transactions in a new cryptocurrency called lazycoin.
The blockchain uses RSA public and private keys for signing transactions and SHA-256 has hash digest for transactions and blocks.
The blockchain is completely autonomous except for a tracker for broadcasting messages among peers. Redis is used to maintain the block chain in all peers and hash pointers to verify transaction.

This was a project for a 2 day Hackathon that took place in NITH during Nimbus 2017.
